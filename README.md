## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection

* Displayed the first few rows of the dataset
* Checked for null values and data types

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Correlation heatmap** to explore relationships between numeric features
* **Bar plots** and **count plots** to analyze class distributions
* **Boxplots** to compare feature distributions across classes

### 3. Data Preprocessing

* Split features and labels
* Train-test split
* Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

### 4. Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* Fitted a KNN model using scikit-learn
* Evaluated predictions with:

  * Accuracy score
  * Confusion matrix
  * Classification report

### 5. Visualization of Results

* Plotted confusion matrix
* Visualized accuracy comparison
